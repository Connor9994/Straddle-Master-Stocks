## Overview

This Python script analyzes SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) options data to calculate and export straddle and strangle strategies for various expiration dates. The tool fetches real-time options data from Yahoo Finance and generates a comprehensive Excel workbook with detailed analysis.

## Features

- **Complete Options Chain Data**: Retrieves 100% of available SPY call and put options
- **Current Price Analysis**: Automatically detects the current SPY price and rounds to nearest strike price
- **Strategy Analysis**: Calculates straddle and strangle strategies with break-even points
- **Multi-Sheet Excel Export**: Creates organized Excel workbook with separate sheets for each expiration date
- **Risk Analysis**: Computes break-even ranges and profit/loss spans for various option combinations

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches all available SPY options expiration dates
- Retrieves both call and put options for each expiration
- Calculates midpoint prices (mark) from bid-ask spreads

### 2. Core Analysis
- **Straddle Analysis**: Analyzes options with the same strike price (Â±10 points from current price)
- **Strangle Analysis**: Analyzes out-of-the-money call and put combinations
- **Break-even Calculation**: Computes upper and lower break-even points for each strategy

### 3. Output Structure
The generated Excel file contains:
- **SPY_Chain Sheet**: Complete raw options data
- **Date-Specific Sheets**: For each expiration date, includes:
  - Straddle analysis for strikes around current price
  - Strangle analysis for various strike combinations
  - Break-even ranges and span calculations

## Key Metrics Calculated

- **Break-even Up**: Upper break-even price (strike + total premium)
- **Break-even Down**: Lower break-even price (strike - total premium)
- **Span**: Difference between break-even points (profit range width)

## Usage

Simply run the script to:
1. Fetch current SPY options data
2. Analyze straddle and strangle strategies
3. Generate `SPYChain.xlsx` with comprehensive analysis

## Dependencies

- `pandas` - Data manipulation and Excel export
- `numpy` - Numerical operations and filtering
- `yfinance` - Yahoo Finance API for options data
- `openpyxl` - Excel file handling
- `datetime` - Date processing utilities
